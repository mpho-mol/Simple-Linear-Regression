Simple linear regression is a statistical method that models the relationship, which is assumed to be linear, between a single independent variable X and a dependent variable Y by fitting a linear equation to the observed data. It forms an essential technique in statistics and data analysis and is a building block in machine learning. The equation for simple linear regression is expressed as Y = aX + b where a and b represent the intercept and slope respectively. The aim of simple linear regression is to estimate the values of a and b that best fit the observed data points by the method of least squares. Simple linear regression is related to machine learning because it is the basis of predictive modelling on which more complex models can be formed.

The task was completed on Jupyter notebook using the data in the insurance.csv file in order to determine how age affects insurance costs. First, a scatter plot is plotted with age on the x-axis and charges on the y-axis. Then a model is fitted to the data and predictions are made on the data using LinearRegression from sklearn.linear_model. Lastly, another scatter plot is plotted with the best-fit line.
